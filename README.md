# CI/CD Pipeline for Spring Boot Application with Jenkins, ArgoCD, and Kubernetes

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for a Spring Boot application, using Jenkins, ArgoCD, and Kubernetes. The pipeline automates the build, test, and deployment processes, ensuring a smooth workflow from code changes to deployment in a Kubernetes cluster. The project includes code quality checks, security scanning, Docker image management, and automated deployment using GitOps principles.

## Goals

The main goals of this project are:
- Automate the build and deployment of a Spring Boot application using a CI/CD pipeline.
- Integrate tools for code quality, security scanning, and vulnerability management.
- Leverage containerization and orchestration for seamless deployments in Kubernetes.
- Automate the deployment process using ArgoCD and GitOps practices.
- Provide an end-to-end solution for continuous delivery, ensuring high-quality and secure software.

## Key Components

### 1. **Jenkins Pipeline**
- **Build and Test**: The pipeline automatically builds the Spring Boot application using Maven, runs unit tests, and generates a build artifact.
- **Code Quality**: SonarQube is integrated to perform code quality checks and static analysis on the codebase.
- **Security Scanning**: OWASP Dependency Check is used to identify vulnerabilities in the application's dependencies. Additionally, Trivy is used to scan Docker images for security vulnerabilities.
- **Docker Image Management**: The Spring Boot application is containerized using Docker, and the Docker image is pushed to DockerHub after passing all the necessary tests and scans.

### 2. **Kubernetes Deployment**
- **Deployment Manifest**: The `deployment.yaml` file is updated automatically by the Jenkins pipeline to reflect the latest Docker image version.
- **Service Manifest**: The application is exposed through a Kubernetes Service (`service.yaml`), making it accessible within or outside the cluster.

### 3. **GitOps with ArgoCD**
- ArgoCD is used to manage the continuous deployment of the application to the Kubernetes cluster.
- GitOps is a development methodology where the entire deployment process is declaratively managed via version-controlled code. This ensures that the infrastructure and applications are always in sync with the state described in the Git repository.
- ArgoCD monitors the GitHub repository containing the Kubernetes manifests and automatically applies changes when updates are detected. This ensures reliable and consistent deployments without manual intervention.

### 4. **SonarQube Integration**
- SonarQube is integrated into the Jenkins pipeline to ensure that the code meets quality standards and follows best practices.
- The tool provides insights into code smells, potential bugs, and other quality issues, helping developers maintain a clean codebase.

### 5. **Security and Vulnerability Scans**
- OWASP Dependency Check scans for known vulnerabilities in the project's dependencies, ensuring that the application does not introduce security risks.
- Trivy scans Docker images for vulnerabilities before pushing them to DockerHub, providing an additional layer of security.

## Technologies Used
- **Jenkins**: CI/CD automation tool for building, testing, and deploying applications.
- **ArgoCD**: Continuous deployment tool based on GitOps principles.
- **Kubernetes**: Container orchestration platform for managing the application's deployment.
- **Docker**: Containerization platform used to build and manage Docker images.
- **SonarQube**: Code quality and security analysis tool.
- **OWASP Dependency Check**: Security tool for identifying vulnerabilities in application dependencies.
- **Trivy**: Vulnerability scanner for Docker images.
- **GitHub**: Version control system to store application and deployment code.
- **Spring Boot**: Java framework for building microservices.

## Pipeline Stages

1. **Checkout**: The Jenkins pipeline clones the Spring Boot application repository from GitHub.
2. **Build**: The Spring Boot application is built using Maven (`mvnw clean install`).
3. **Test**: Unit tests are executed as part of the Maven build process.
4. **SonarQube Analysis**: Code is analyzed using SonarQube for potential bugs, code smells, and security vulnerabilities.
5. **Security Scanning**:
   - **OWASP Dependency Check**: Scans application dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
   - **Trivy Scan**: Scans the Docker image for security vulnerabilities.
6. **Docker Build and Push**: A Docker image is built for the Spring Boot application and pushed to DockerHub.
7. **Kubernetes Manifests Update**: The `deployment.yaml` file in the Kubernetes manifest repository is updated with the new Docker image version.
8. **Git Commit**: The updated `deployment.yaml` file is committed and pushed to the GitHub repository.
9. **ArgoCD Sync**: ArgoCD automatically detects changes in the Kubernetes manifests and applies the updated deployment to the Kubernetes cluster.

## Conclusion

This project showcases the power of automation in software development through CI/CD, containerization, and GitOps. By leveraging tools like Jenkins, ArgoCD, Docker, Kubernetes, and SonarQube, the project achieves a fully automated workflow for continuous integration and deployment, with a focus on code quality and security.
